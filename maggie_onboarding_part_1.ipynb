An API essentially allows something like Python to communicate with a service.  You pass data or other information into an API and it does something for you or returns information for you.  A common example is a weather API.  In Python, you send a request to an API with specific parameters, like location, date ranges, and type of weather you want to see, and then the weather API will return a file with information on historical weather at that location, in that date range, and for that weather type.\n",
